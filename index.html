    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper ,or in other media</li><br>
        <li><span class="main">CSS is not necessary</span>.<span class="main1">CSS saves a lot of work</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li><span  id="aman">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</span></li>
    </ol>

    <h1>CSS Can be added to HTML document in 3 ways</h1>
    <br>
    <ul class="spacing">
        <li>Inline- by using the style inside HTML element1</li>
        <li>Internal- by  using element in the head section</li>
        <li>The most common way add CSS .is to keep the styles in external CSS files.however.<span class="arvind" >in this tutorials we will use inline and internal styles.</span> because this is easier to demonstrate. and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special url .to link directly  to an element and it is used by javascript.</p>
    <p1>In CSS selectors are used to target a specific elements or range of element on a webpage Once an element has targeted,a style or set of style can applied to the  elements</p1><br><br>
    <p2>There is a wide range of selectors available .Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p2>
